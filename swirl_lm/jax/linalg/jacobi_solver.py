"""Jacobi-based Poisson solver with stretched grid support (JAX port).

Port of `swirl_lm.linalg.jacobi_solver.ThreeWeightForPressure`. Wraps the
low-level `ThreeWeight` Jacobi implementation with metric-weight generation
for the pressure correction equation on stretched grids.

For a Low-Mach formulation on a stretched grid, the Poisson equation
  nabla^2 p = rhs
is reformulated in computational coordinates with scale factors h0, h1, h2:
  w0 = h1*h2/h0,  w1 = h0*h2/h1,  w2 = h0*h1/h2
  rhs_modified = rhs * h0*h1*h2

For the anelastic case, each weight is additionally multiplied by a reference
density rho_0.
