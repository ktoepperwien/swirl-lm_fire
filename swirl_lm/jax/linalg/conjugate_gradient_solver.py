"""A JAX library for a distributed conjugate gradient solver.

Uses the conjugate gradient method to iteratively solve a linear system
A x = b, where A is a Hermitian semi-definite operator.

The implementation is "matrix-free", accepting the linear operator `A` as a
`Callable` that evaluates the action of `A` on a given input vector `x`.
In a distributed setting with JAX, the sharding is handled by
`jax.sharding.Mesh`
and the operator `A` is responsible for any required halo exchange.

The inner product is also provided as a `Callable`, typically wrapping
`common_ops.global_dot` with a `jax.sharding.Mesh`.

  Either the number of iterations reaches `max_iterations` or `rho` (the squared
  L2 norm of the residual or its L2 norm reduction relative to `b`) is smaller
  than or equal to `tol` will terminate the iteration.

  Args:
    linear_operator: A `Callable` giving the action of multiplying a Hermitian
      semi-definite operator with a vector (3D `jax.Array`). Must handle halo
      exchange internally, and set halos to zero before returning.
    dot: A `Callable` that computes the inner product of two vectors.
    b: The right-hand-side (rhs) vector (3D `jax.Array`).
    max_iterations: The maximum number of iterations.
    tol: A predefined tolerance for the residual's absolute L2 norm or relative
      L2 norm reduction relative to `b`.
    x0: The initial guess to the solution vector. Halos must be updated before
      calling this function.
    l2_norm_reduction: Whether to use `tol` as a relative L2 norm for the
      residual, relative to the input rhs `b`.
    component_wise_distance_fn: An optional function that takes a `lhs` (`A *
      x`) and returns its componentwise distance to the `rhs` i.e. `b`.
      Convergence is indicated when non-positive. The overall convergence
      criterion is a logical OR of the L2 norm condition and this condition.
    reprojection: A `Callable` that performs reprojection onto the orthogonal
      complement of the null space. Useful for singular systems (e.g., all
      Neumann BCs), where it is equivalent to subtracting off the mean.
    preconditioner: An optional preconditioner M approximating A^{-1}. Applied
      to the residual to improve convergence rate.
    internal_dtype: Optional dtype for internal CG computation (e.g.
      jnp.float64). When set, inputs are cast to this dtype before the CG loop
      and the solution is cast back afterwards. Useful for avoiding numeric
      error accumulation in ill-conditioned problems.
